# Java-Programming-Concepts
This project was created for COP 3804: Intermediate Java Programming at Florida International University. It demonstrates several fundamental Java programming concepts, including:

Parallel Arrays – Organizing and displaying related data sets.
Enhanced For Loops – Cleaner and more efficient iteration through arrays.
String Splitting & Tokenization – Breaking strings into pieces using custom delimiters.
ArrayLists – Dynamic data structures for flexible storage and retrieval.
Objects in Collections – Storing multiple data types together in a single list.
The goal of this project is to integrate these features into one application to show how they work together in real-world programming scenarios.

**Features**

Displays tabular data using parallel arrays
Uses enhanced for loops for improved code readability
Demonstrates string splitting using different delimiters
Implements ArrayLists to add, remove, and manipulate data dynamically
Stores mixed data types inside collections and iterates through them
